## Github Projects

### Data Science Portfolio Website

#### [Homepage](https://dagartga.github.io/)
- My main portfolio website that contains the following data science projects
#### [Quantifying Sales Uplift with Causal Impact Analysis](https://dagartga.github.io/2024/03/10/causal-impact.html)
- Analyzed the impact of a "Delivery Club" special on sales for a grocery retailer using a Python causal impact library, revealing a 41.1% uplift in sales.
#### [Web App for Parkinson's Prediction using Boosted Models](https://dagartga.github.io/2024/03/21/parkinsons-classification.html)
- Developed a predictive model for Parkinson's severity using boosted tree models with feature engineering, resulting in significant improvement in F1 score and recall.
#### [Understanding Alcohol Product Relationships Using Association Rule Learning](https://dagartga.github.io/2024/03/08/association-rule-learning.html)
- Analyzed customer buying patterns to uncover product relationships in alcohol retail, revealing insights about customer preferences.
#### [Compressing Feature Space For Classification Using PCA](https://dagartga.github.io/2024/03/07/pca.html)
- Predicted customer behavior using historical music sales data, achieving high accuracy through feature space compression and Random Forest.
#### [The "You Are What You Eat" Customer Segmentation](https://dagartga.github.io/2024/03/05/customer-segmentation.html)
- Segmented customers for a grocery chain to provide marketing insights based on dietary preferences.
#### [UK Bank Customer Demographics Tableau Dashboard](https://dagartga.github.io/2024/03/06/uk-bank-customer-analysis-with-tableau.html)
- Created a dashboard for targeted marketing campaigns based on bank customer demographics.
 
### Streamlit Apps

#### [Parkinsons Severity Prediction](https://boosted-models-for-parkinsons-prediction.streamlit.app/)
- Boosted Tree models for predicting the maximum severity of Parkinsons for clinical patients based on their protein and peptide mass spectrometry quantities.
- Explainable results using Feature Importance for each patient and a description of the top proteins.
  
#### [Salifort Motors Employee Retention Prediction](https://salifort-motors-employee-retention.streamlit.app/)
- Uses an XGBoost Classifier to predict how likely an employee will leave based on the HR data.
- Provides SHAP values to explain the probability score assigned to the employee.

### Deep Learning Project

#### [Transfer Learning for X-Ray Image Classification](https://github.com/dagartga/Transfer_Learning_X-Ray_Classification)
- Used **DenseNet-201** pre-trained neural network and fine-tuned **one hidden layer** with 4096 nodes and 30% dropout for regularization.
- Solved imbalanced target distribution using class weights to the parameters for the neural network.
- Applied hyperparameter tuning of # of hidden layers, nodes, learning rate, batch size, learning rate decay, and momentum to find optimal values.
- Final Test Statistics:
    - **AUC:** 0.990
    - **F1:** 0.972
    - **Recall:** 0.971
    - **Precision:** 0.973
